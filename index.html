    <h1 class="p-14">What is Art!</h1>
    <p>Creativity is the singular most important human endeavor, because it explores the inexpressible & incomprehensible meaning of Life’s struggle against impermanence!</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>The wicked trick played here is defining something that doesn’t make any fucking sense, why so many forms of creativity, in terms of something that makes even less bloody sense, life’s destiny with death…or…defining human creative exuberance in terms of Life’s glorious impermanence.</p>
