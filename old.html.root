    <h1 class="p-8"><b>What is Art!</b></h1>
    <h1 class="p-4">Creativity is the singular most important human endeavor, because it explores the inexpressible & incomprehensible meaning of Life’s struggle against impermanence!</h1>
    <h1 class="p-4">The wicked trick played here is defining something that doesn’t make any sense, i.e. how so many forms of creativity florish at the biological scale, in terms of something that makes even less bloody sense, i.e. life’s inevitable destiny with death..…in other words, defining human creative exuberance in terms of Life’s glorious impermanence. This absurdity is the source of our deepest drive and meaning. </h1>
